Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of

of this License; and

following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a
whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)

"This implementation" means the copyrightable works distributed by Google as
part of the Go project.

Google hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer and otherwise run,
modify and propagate the contents of this implementation of Go, where such
license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned or controlled
by Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily
infringed by this implementation of Go.  This grant does not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of this
implementation.  If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order
or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that this implementation
of Go or any code incorporated within this implementation of Go constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent
infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License for this
implementation of Go shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open
framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts,
including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or
sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by
derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their
derivatives.

DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the

"This implementation" means the copyrightable works distributed by Google as
part of the Go project.

Google hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer and otherwise run,
modify and propagate the contents of this implementation of Go, where such
license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned or controlled
by Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily
infringed by this implementation of Go.  This grant does not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of this
implementation.  If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order
or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that this implementation
of Go or any code incorporated within this implementation of Go constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent
infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License for this
implementation of Go shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)

"This implementation" means the copyrightable works distributed by Google as
part of the Go project.

Google hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer and otherwise run,
modify and propagate the contents of this implementation of Go, where such
license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned or controlled
by Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily
infringed by this implementation of Go.  This grant does not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of this
implementation.  If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order
or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that this implementation
of Go or any code incorporated within this implementation of Go constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent
infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License for this
implementation of Go shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a
whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree

under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
Modifications made by that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.

The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by
the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications
are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the
rights conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.

You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
the Contributor of the Modification.  You may not remove or alter any
copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software,
or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
of Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not
on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form
does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised
and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no
one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which
You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes
a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your
Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if
You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the
license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ
from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant
is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the
Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period
You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that
term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer
software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
with only those rights set forth herein.  This U.S. Government Rights clause is
in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
with the United States export administration regulations (and the export
control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

1. Definitions

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or
phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other
form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose
of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work,
performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the
purpose of this License.

   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in
unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting
separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into
a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered
an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

   c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
Work as stated below:

   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
original work has been modified.";

   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

   e. For the avoidance of doubt:

      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
License;

      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
and,

      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member
of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
this License.  You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.

   b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a),
keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the
name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to
the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with
Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum
such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For
the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section
for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or
imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the
Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

   c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections,
You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in
relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in
which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the
right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's
honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate,
this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law,
to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this
License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED
TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR
THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals
or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force
and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),
the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO
Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take
effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite
of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not
granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in
the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights
under applicable law.

Creative Commons Corporation (Creative Commons) is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative
Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship.
Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an
as-is basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its
licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any
related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under
an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensors permission is not necessary for any
reasonfor example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyrightthen that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for
the public.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights
in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor
receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.

Section 1  Definitions.

Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is
derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed
Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified
in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by
the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material
is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always
produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving
image.  Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Public License.  Copyright and Similar Rights
means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including,
without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis
Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.
For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section
2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.  Effective Technological
Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not
be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
agreements.  Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies
to Your use of the Licensed Material.  Licensed Material means the artistic or
literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this
Public License.  Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright
and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.  Licensor means the individual(s) or
entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.  Share means to provide
material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under
the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance,
distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make
material available to the public including in ways that members of the public
may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.  You means the
individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License.
Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2  Scope.

License grant.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
Licensed Material to: reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in
part; and produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.  Exceptions and
Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply
to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply
with its terms and conditions.  Term. The term of this Public License is
specified in Section 6(a).  Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.
The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications
necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this
Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4)
never produces Adapted Material.  Downstream recipients.  Offer from the
Licensor  Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material
automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed
Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.  No downstream
restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed
Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient
of the Licensed Material.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License
constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are,
or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to
receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

Other rights.  Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or
agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent
necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.  To the
extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You
for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties.

Section 3  License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

Attribution.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material: identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); a copyright notice; a
notice that refers to this Public License; a notice that refers to the
disclaimer of warranties; a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
extent reasonably practicable; indicate if You modified the Licensed Material
and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and indicate the
Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text
of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.  You may satisfy the
conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium,
means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it
may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to
a resource that includes the required information.  If requested by the
Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A)
to the extent reasonably practicable.  If You Share Adapted Material You
produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the
Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.

Section 4  Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Material:

for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
database; if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material; and You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if
You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5  Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible,
the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no
representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material,
whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be
liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out
of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor
has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or
damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part,
this limitation may not apply to You.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall
be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6  Term and Termination.

This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured,
provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon
express reinstatement by the Licensor.  For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies
for Your violations of this Public License.  For the avoidance of doubt, the
Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or
conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however,
doing so will not terminate this Public License.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8
survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7  Other Terms and Conditions.

The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  Any arrangements,
understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein
are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public
License.

Section 8  Interpretation.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public
License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.  No term or condition of
this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless
expressly agreed to by the Licensor.  Nothing in this Public License
constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any
privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the
legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding,
Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it

You. For purposes of this definition, control means (a) the power,
direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than fifty percent
(50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
license:

under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display,
perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an
unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its
Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third partys
modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions
with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or

under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute
the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section
10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms
of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the
recipients rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form
how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a
timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the
recipient; and

You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients rights in
the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary
License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,
further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy
known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
liability specific to any jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this
is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall
terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an as is basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of
defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The
entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with
You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No
use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of
the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply
to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such partys
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
prevent a partys ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,
no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of
the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from
this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice
described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain
one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - Incompatible With Secondary Licenses Notice

This Source Code Form is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, as
defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license
they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under
an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensors permission is not necessary for any
reasonfor example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
copyrightthen that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes
be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for
the public.

non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
Licensed Material to: reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in
part; and produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.  Exceptions and

modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications
necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this
Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4)

from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the
Adapters License You apply.  No downstream restrictions. You may not offer
or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so
restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
Material.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of

provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent
necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.  To the
extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You
for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right
to collect such royalties.

Section 3  License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

Attribution.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material: identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); a copyright notice; a
notice that refers to this Public License; a notice that refers to the
disclaimer of warranties; a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
extent reasonably practicable; indicate if You modified the Licensed Material

Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text
of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.  You may satisfy the
conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium,
means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it

apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this
version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.  You must include the text of,
or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy
this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context
in which You Share Adapted Material.  You may not offer or impose any
additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.

Section 4  Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
Your use of the Licensed Material:

for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
database; if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database
in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and You must
comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial
portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace
Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5  Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible,
the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no
representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material,
whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer
may not apply to You.  To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be
liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out
of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor
has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or
damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part,
this limitation may not apply to You.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall
be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6  Term and Termination.

This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured,
provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon
express reinstatement by the Licensor.  For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies
for Your violations of this Public License.  For the avoidance of doubt, the
Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or
conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however,
doing so will not terminate this Public License.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8
survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7  Other Terms and Conditions.

The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  Any arrangements,
understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein
are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public
License.

Section 8  Interpretation.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public
License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.  No term or condition of
this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless
expressly agreed to by the Licensor.  Nothing in this Public License
constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any
privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the
legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

-------------- SECTION 7: GNU General Public License, V1.0 -------------

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone
is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most
of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you
received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that
there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors'
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that
their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to
change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area
of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit
the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

		       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work
"based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is
no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy
of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only
to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License
only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This
License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided
by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running
the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
restricting circumvention of such measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'
legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that
this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply
to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give
all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement
modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply,
along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work,
and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate
such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces
that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do
so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and
its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections
4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed
on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)
access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed only
occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with
such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding
Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.  You need
not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object
code.  If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding
Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these
requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work
are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying
the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a
particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that
class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,
the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product
has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure
that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under
this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this
requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the
ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the
work has been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and
with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must
require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the
Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added
by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to
a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by
works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways
as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors
of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received
it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this
License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that
term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits
relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work
material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the
further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that
apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of
a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any
patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If
your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not
qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe
copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives
a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's
predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a
right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this
License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed
is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor
version.  For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to
grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of
its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as
an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent
infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such
an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means
you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that
you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant
a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing
them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients
of the covered work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope
of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under
this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent
of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants,
to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered
work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at
all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty
for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain
entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey
the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network
will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or
any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all
civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption
of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> This program comes with
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.  This is free software, and
you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for
details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might
be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

-------------- SECTION 8: GNU General Public License, V2.0 -------------

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street,
Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and
distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as
"you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code
or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51
Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.  This is free software,
and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead of this License.

-------------- SECTION 9: GNU General Public License, V3.0 -------------

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone
is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most
of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you
received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that
there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors'
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that
their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to
change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area
of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit
the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

		       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work
"based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is
no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy
of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only
to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License
only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This
License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided
by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running
the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
restricting circumvention of such measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'
legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that
this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply
to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give
all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement
modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply,
along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work,
and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate
such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces
that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do
so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and
its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections
4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed
on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)
access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed only
occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with
such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding
Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.  You need
not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object
code.  If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding
Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these
requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work
are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying
the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a
particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that
class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,
the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product
has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure
that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under
this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this
requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the
ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the
work has been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and
with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must
require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the
Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added
by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to
a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by
works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways
as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors
of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received
it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this
License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that
term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits
relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work
material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the
further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that
apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of
a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any
patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If
your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not
qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe
copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives
a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's
predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a
right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this
License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed
is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor
version.  For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to
grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of
its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as
an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent
infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such
an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means
you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that
you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant
a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing
them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients
of the covered work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope
of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under
this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent
of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants,
to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered
work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at
all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty
for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain
entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey
the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network
will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or
any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms
and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all
civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption
of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> This program comes with
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.  This is free software, and
you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for
details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands might
be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

--------- SECTION 10: GNU Library General Public License, V2.0 ---------

	     GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  51 Franklin Street, Fifth
Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301 USA.  Everyone is permitted to copy and
distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is numbered 2
because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially
designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose
authors decide to use it.  You can use it for your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link a
program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes
to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the
library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library.  If the
library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will
individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program
into proprietary software.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This license,
the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated
libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to
read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the
ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they
blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program
and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without changing the
library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running
a utility program or application program.  However, in a textual and legal
sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original
library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public
License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because
most developers did not use the libraries.  We concluded that weaker conditions
might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of
those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves.
This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of
non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a
user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in
them.  (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header
files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of
the Library.)  The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free
libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library".  The former contains code derived
from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General
Public License rather than by this special one.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may
be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also
called "this License").  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so
as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the Library" means either
the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program
using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the
use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on
what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
with the Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
of its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore,
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by
this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.
(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License
has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not
make any other change in these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but
is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".  The executable is
therefore covered by this License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
the Library even though the source code is not.  Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.  Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing
portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice,
provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own
use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You
must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
Also, you must do one of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work
(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is
an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work
that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents
of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile
the application to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a
charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials
from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
from it.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
together in an executable that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of
it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or
any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the Library General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting redistribution under
these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published by the
Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Library General Public License for more
details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public License
along with this library; if not, write to the Free Foundation, Inc., 51
Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110- 1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary.  Here
is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob'
(a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

--------- SECTION 11: GNU Lesser General Public License, V2.1 ----------

	      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  51 Franklin Street,
Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301 USA.  Everyone is permitted to copy and
distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the
successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version
number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you
can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
are informed that you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes
to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is modified by someone
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected
by problems that might be introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent
holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of
the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It
also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over
competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use the
ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as
widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General
Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library".  The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is addressed as
"you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so
as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the Library" means either
the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program
using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the
use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on
what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
with the Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
of its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore,
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by
this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.
(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License
has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not
make any other change in these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but
is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".  The executable is
therefore covered by this License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
the Library even though the source code is not.  Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.  Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing
portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice,
provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own
use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You
must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
Also, you must do one of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work
(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is
an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work
that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents
of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile
the application to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a
charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials
from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
from it.  However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
together in an executable that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of
it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or
any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting redistribution under
these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the
Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your
option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more
details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License
along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110- 1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary.  Here
is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob'
(a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

---------- SECTION 12: GNU Lesser General Public License, V3.0 ----------

		 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone
is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by
the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.  Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then
you may convey a copy of the modified version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a
reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a
modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in
the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly
with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
Linked Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option
4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding
Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must
provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of
the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms
of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work
based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public
License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

----------- SECTION 13: GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3.0 ----------

		    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 19 November
2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone
is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation
with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, our General
Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two
steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made
in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become
available for other developers to incorporate.  Many developers of free
software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However,
in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come
about.  The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code
to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure
that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the
community.  It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source
code of the modified version running there to the users of that server.
Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server,
gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by
Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is a different license,
not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the
Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

		       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work
"based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is
no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy
of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only
to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.
For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License
only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This
License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided
by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running
the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
restricting circumvention of such measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'
legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that
this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply
to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give
all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement
modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply,
along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work,
and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate
such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces
that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do
so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and
its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections
4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed
on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including
a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)
access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed only
occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with
such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding
Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.  You need
not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object
code.  If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding
Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these
requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work
are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying
the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a
particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that
class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,
the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product
has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure
that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is
transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of
how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under
this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this
requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the
ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the
work has been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and
with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must
require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the
Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added
by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to
a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by
works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways
as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors
of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received
it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this
License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that
term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits
relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work
material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the
further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that
apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable
terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of
a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements
apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any
patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If
your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not
qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy
of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe
copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives
a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's
predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a
right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this
License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed
is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor
version.  For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to
grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of
its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as
an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent
infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such
an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3)
arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to
extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means
you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that
you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant
a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing
them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients
of the covered work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope
of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under
this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an
arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent
of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants,
to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered
work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at
all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty
for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way
you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain
entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting
with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such
interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version
by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of
software.  This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for
any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is
incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the
resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part
which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain
governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not
specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the
GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for
the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts
shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all
civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption
of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the
Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option)
any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Affero General Public License for more
details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network,
you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source.
For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display
a "Source" link that leads users to an archive of the code.  There are many
ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for
different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
