4. Regression test passed
5. docker create container, with ip address correctly set in the above ip range

#Test Cases:

#Test Steps
1. Create with invalid container network: <WrongNet>:alias
2. Verify create failed with WrongNet is not found

#Test Steps
1. Create with container network: <stand switch network name>:alias in VC
2. Verify create failed with standard network is not supported

#Test Steps
1. Create with container network: <dpg name>:net1 in VC or <stand switch network name>:net1 in ESXi
2. Verify create passed
3. Regression test passed
4. Verify docker network ls command to show net1 network

#Test Steps
1. Create with container network: <dpg name> in VC or <stand switch network name> in ESXi
2. Verify create passed
3. Regression test passed
4. Verify docker network ls command to show the <vsphere network name> network

#Test Steps
1. Create with two container network map to same alias
2. Verify create failed with two different vsphere network map to same docker network

#Test Steps
1. Create with two container network map to same alias
2. Verify create failed with two different vsphere network map to same docker network

#Test Steps
1. Create with container network mapping
2. Set container network gateway as <dpg name>:1.1.1.1/24
3. Set container network gateway as <dpg name>:192.168.1.0/24
4. Set container network gateway as <wrong name>:192.168.1.0/24
5. Verify create failed for wrong vsphere network name or gateway is not routable

#Test Steps
1. Create with container network mapping
2. Set container ip range as <wrong name>:192.168.2.1-192.168.2.100
3. Set container network gateway as <dpg name>:192.168.1.1/24, and container ip range as <dpg name>:192.168.2.1-192.168.2.100
4. Verify create failed for wrong vsphere network name or ip range is wrong

#Test Steps
1. Create with container network mapping
2. Set container DNS as <wrong name>:8.8.8.8
3. Set container DNS as <dpg name>:abcdefg
4. Verify create failed for wrong vsphere name or wrong dns format

#Test Steps
1. Create with container network mapping <dpg name>:net1
2. Set container network gateway as <dpg name>:192.168.1.1/24
3. Set container ip range as <dpg name>:192.168.1.2-192.168.1.100
4. Set container DNS as <dpg name>:<correct dns>
5. Verify create passed
6. Integration test passed
7. Docker network ls show net1
8. Docker container created with network attached with net1, got ip address inside of network range
9. Docker create another container, and link to previous one, can talk to the the first container successfully


# Test Cases: VCH static IP

# Test Steps
1. Create with static IP address for external network (client and management networks unspecified
   default to same port group as external network)
2. Verify debug output shows specified static IP address correctly assigned and copied to client and
   management networks

# Test Steps
1. Create with static IP address for client network and specify client, external, and management
   networks to be on same port group
2. Verify debug output shows specified static IP address correctly assigned and copied to external
   and management networks

# Test Steps
1. Create with static IP address for management network and specify client, external, and management
   networks to be on the same port group
2. Verify debug output shows specified static IP address correctly assigned and copied to client
   and external management networks

# Test Steps
1. Create with static IP address for external network and specify client and management networks to
   be on different port group
2. Verify debug output shows specified static IP address correctly assigned
3. Verify debug output shows client and management networks set to DHCP

# Test Steps
1. Create with static IP address for external network on `external-network` port group and a static
   IP address for client network on `client-network` port group
2. Verify debug output shows correct IP address assigned to each interface

# Test Steps
1. Create with static IP address for each external network and client network and specify both to be
   on the same port group
2. Verify output shows configuration error and install does not proceed

# Test Steps
1. Create with static IP address for external network and a static IP address for client network.
   Specify the addresses to be on the same subnet, but assign each network to a different port
   group
2. Verify output shows warning that assigning the same subnet to different port groups is
   unsupported
