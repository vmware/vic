Test 5-4 - High Availability
=======

#Purpose:
To verify the VIC appliance works in when the vCenter appliance is using high availability

#Environment:
This test requires access to VMWare Nimbus cluster for dynamic ESXi and vCenter creation

#Test Steps:
1. Deploy a new vCenter with 3 ESXi hosts in a cluster
2. Enable HA on the cluster:  
```govc cluster.change -drs-enabled -ha-enabled /ha-datacenter/host/cls```
3. Deploy a new VCH Appliance to the cluster  
4. Run a variety of docker commands on the VCH appliance
5. Power off the ESXi host that the VCH is currently running on
6. Run a variety of docker commands on the VCH appliance

#Expected Outcome:
The VCH appliance should deploy without error and each of the docker commands executed against it should return without error

#Possible Problems:
None
