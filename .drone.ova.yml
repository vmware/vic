# After any change to this file you MUST regenerate and checkin
# a .drone.sec even if no secrets were changed. The secrets file is tied
# to a specific .drone.yml so artifacts will not be uploaded to (OR DOWNLOADED
# FROM) GCP in following builds without an updated .drone.sec
#
# When you are ready to submit a pull request, you must regenerate .drone.sec for the vmware/vic repo:
#
# $ drone -s https://ci.vmware.run -t ${DRONE_TOKEN} secure --in "secrets.yml" --out ".drone.sec" --repo vmware/vic --yaml ".drone.yml"
#
# The secrets file is in our local git repo.  Ask mhagen for access.
