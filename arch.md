### vSphere Integrated Containers Architecture

#### Overview

VIC is a product designed to tightly integrate container workflow, lifecycle and provisioning with the vSphere SDDC. In VIC, a container is a first-class citizen provisioned into a _Virtual Container Host_ (VCH) and able to directly integrate with vSphere infrastructure capabilities, such as networking and storage features.

To learn more about the differences between the VIC model and a traditional software-virtualized container, [see here](docs/arch/vic-container-abstraction.md)
