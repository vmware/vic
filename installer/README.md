# VIC Unified Installer

This directory will host all the code that is going to be part of the VIC unified installer OVA.

It is currently under heavy development and not suitable for any use except for development, this file will be updated to reflect the status of the installer as development progresses.

### Usage

```
esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1
esxcli network firewall set --enabled false
```

The machine that is running Packer (make ova-release) must be reachable from the launched VM and
have `ovftool` installed

#### Build bundle and OVA

First, we have to set the revisions of the components we want to bundle in the OVA:

```
export BUILD_VICENGINE_REVISION=1.1.1-rc1  # Required (https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/vic-engine-releases)
export BUILD_HARBOR_REVISION=v1.1.1-rc4    # Optional, defaults to dev (https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/harbor-dev-builds)
export BUILD_ADMIRAL_REVISION=v1.1.1       # Optional, defaults to dev (https://hub.docker.com/r/vmware/admiral/tags/)
```

Then set the required env vars for the build environment and make the release:

```
export PACKER_ESX_HOST=1.1.1.1
export PACKER_USER=root
export PACKER_PASSWORD=password
export PACKER_LOG=1  # Optional

make ova-release
```

Deploy OVA with ovftool in a Docker container on ESX host
```
docker run -it --net=host -v ~/go/src/github.com/vmware/vic/bin:/test-bin \
  gcr.io/eminent-nation-87317/vic-integration-test:1.29 ovftool --acceptAllEulas --X:injectOvfEnv \
  --X:enableHiddenProperties -st=OVA --powerOn --noSSLVerify=true -ds=datastore1 -dm=thin \
  --net:Network="VM Network" \
  --prop:appliance.root_pwd="VMware1\!" --prop:appliance.permit_root_login=True --prop:registry.port=443 \
  --prop:management_portal.port=8282 --prop:registry.admin_password="VMware1\!" \
  --prop:registry.db_password="VMware1\!" /test-bin/vic-1.1.0-a84985b.ova \
  vi://root:password@192.168.1.20
```

### Troubleshooting

#### ova-release failed

Solution: Cleanup datastore by removing the `vic` folder

Solution: Disable firewall on ESX host `esxcli network firewall set --enabled false`

#### No IP address ready

```

```

Solution: Disable firewall on the build machine. The launched VM is unable to get the kickstart file
from your build machine.
