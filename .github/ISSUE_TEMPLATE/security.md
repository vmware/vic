> VMware encourages users who become aware of a security vulnerability in VMware products to contact VMware with details of the vulnerability. VMware has established an email address that should be used for reporting a vulnerability. Please send descriptions of any vulnerabilities found to security@vmware.com. Please include details on the software and hardware configuration of your system so that we can duplicate the issue being reported.
> 
> **Note:** We encourage use of encrypted email. Our public PGP key is found at https://kb.vmware.com/kb/1055.
> 
> VMware hopes that users encountering a new vulnerability will contact us privately as it is in the best interests of our customers that VMware has an opportunity to investigate and confirm a suspected vulnerability before it becomes public knowledge.
> 
> In the case of vulnerabilities found in third-party software components used in VMware products, please also notify VMware as described above.
