Example (from https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories):
 * As a vice president of marketing, I want to select a holiday season to be used when reviewing the performance of past advertising campaigns so that I can identify profitable ones.
    * Support holidays that span two calendar years (none span three).
    * Holiday seasons can be set from one holiday to the next (such as Thanksgiving to Christmas).
    * Holiday seasons can be set to be a number of days prior to the holiday.
