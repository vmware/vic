# Introduction to vSphere Integrated Containers

vSphere Integrated Containers provide developers the portability, speed, and agility of using containers and provide IT Ops the management, security, and visibility they require to run workloads in production. VIC enables IT teams to run traditional and containerized workloads side-by-side on existing infrastructure seamlessly.

vSphere Integrated Containers (VIC) uses Docker containers on top of vSphere infrastructure to optimize the datacenter. 

From a developer's perspective, VIC is a seamless Docker interface for containers with a vSphere back end. You can deploy, test, and run container processes faster in the same environment with traditional applications.

From an operations perspective, VIC leverages existing technology such as health monitoring, performance analysis, compliance, and security to move businesses faster. 

* Security and isolation: minimal overhead using instant clone technology
* Storage and data persistence: enable full state services to support cloud native databases
* Networking: network micro segmentation and policy based security, NSX provides greater visibility to container behavior
* Service-level agreements for container workloads: reduce planned and unplanned downtime with High Availability and vMotion
* Management: Administrators can use vCenter Server to view and manage containers without additional tools or training. VIC provides consistent management and configuration compliance across private and public clouds with vRealize Suite

VIC consists of various components to manage, execute and monitor containers.
* Virtual Container Host
* vSphere Web Client Plugin
* Docker API
