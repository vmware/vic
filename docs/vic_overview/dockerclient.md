# Docker Client

Docker clients communicate with the VCH, not each container, so you can see aggregated pools of vSphere resources, including storage and memory allocations. 

You can pull standard container images from the Docker hub or private registry.

Containers run on the Photon OS Linux kernel. You can specify network port mappings. 

You can create, run, stop, and delete containers using standard docker commands and verify these actions in the vSphere Web Client.
