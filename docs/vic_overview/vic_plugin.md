## vSphere Web Client Plugin

You can monitor and manage containers using the VIC plugin in the vSphere Web Cient. 

The plugin allows you to create VCHs, perform administrative tasks on containers such as resource allocation, port mapping, and manage communications between administrators, developers, and application owners during troubleshooting.

You can create, run, stop, and delete containers using standard docker commands and verify these actions in the vSphere Web Client.
