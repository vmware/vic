# Docker CLI Compatibility
VIC attempts to be compatible with the Docker client (CLI); however, there are some differences. The CLI differences are documented below, alphabetically. Note, the operations listed as supported but with differences does not mean incompatible. It means most of these operations support either a smaller subset of the parameters or the request/response parameters have different meanings that apply to running in an ESX or vCenter environment.

The list is organized into 3 separate tables. The first table lists CLI operations that are supported in the first version of VIC. The second table lists operations that VIC may support in the future.

### VIC Support

|Docker CLI Operation | support viable | technical priority |
|--- | ---| ---|
|attach | YES| P0 - feel good factor and interactive debug |
|cp | YES| P1 - live copy |
|create | *Yes - differences*| P0 - core function: use |
|events | *Yes - differences*| P1 - necessary for automation |
|history | YES| - |
|images | YES| P0 - core function: admin |
|login | YES| - |
|logout | YES| - |
|logs | YES| P0 - core function: use |
|network connect| YES| P2 - necessary only for dynamic topology changes |
|network create| *Yes - differences*| P0 - core function: use/admin |
|network disconnect| YES| P2 - symmetrical with connect |
|network ls| YES| P0 - core function: use |
|network rm| YES| - |
|port | YES| P1 - core function: use - necessity reduced if not using NAT model |
|ps | YES| P0 - core function: use/admin |
|pull | YES| P0 - core function: use |
|rm | YES| P0 - core function: use/admin |
|rmi | YES| P1 - core function: admin - maybe less critical in production |
|run | *Yes - differences*| P0 - core function: use |
|rename | YES| - |
|restart | YES| P0 - core function: use |
|start | YES| P0 - core function: use |
|stop | YES| P0 - core function: use |
|tag| YES| - |
|version | YES| P0 - core function: admin |
|volume create| *Yes - differences*| P0 - core function: use/admin |
|volume inspect| YES| P1 - core function: admin - maybe less critical in production |
|volume ls| YES| P0 - core function: use |
|volume rm| YES| P1 - core function: use/admin - depends on dynamism of volume use |
|exec | YES | P1 - interactive debug |
|pause | YES| - |
|stats | YES| P1 - core function: diagnostics |
|top | YES| - |
|unpause | YES| - |
|wait | YES | P1 - necessary for automation |

The technical priority ranking is as follows (assessed with regard to production deployment):
P0 - delay GA if not available
P1 - significant reduction in capability - consider slipping
P2 - confined reduction in capability
-  - not significant in initial use cases

## events

Events **may** may also report ESX and vCenter events.


## info

The information provided by *info* appears similar to those reported by Docker but many of them are specific to vSphere.

## inspect

Some parameters **returned** by *inspect* are specific to vSphere.  Others are not relevant.

### Response:

The response for inspect is a JSON document composed of several inner documents.  The following are the primary subdocuments that differs.  For the rest of the response, please visit,
```
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.22/#inspect-a-container.
```

**AppArmorProfile**

A VIC container isolation unit is a VM. Processes running in a VIC container do not use AppArmor profiles.

An array of mount points.  VIC will provide some form of this.  Here is an example of what Docker returns.

```
    "Mounts": [
        {
            "Name": "fac362...80535",
            "Source": "/data",
            "Destination": "/data",
            "Driver": "local",
            "Mode": "ro,Z",
            "RW": false,
            "Propagation": ""
        }
    ]
```

## network create

The network creation workflow will differ from standard Docker.  The -driver option is ignored.  All networks in VIC are of type *bridged*.  Policies on these networks are administered with vSphere.  This makes exposing containers to the external world much simpler.  In the future, support for VMWare's NSX will be incorporated.  For more information on VIC's networking model, please visit, https://github.com/vmware/vic/blob/master/doc/design/networking/MVPnetworking.md

## volume create

Much like network creation, volume creation also leverages the vSphere infrastructure.  Volumes are just VMDKs created within a VCH.  This gives VIC containers a lot of advantages.  A container can run on any ESX server that is part of the VCH and it's data volume can be on another ESX server.  The container and the data volume can be moved from one ESX server to another within the VCH, and they would be able to connect seamlessly.

Shared volumes between containers will eventually be supported.  Stay tune.

VIC can also leverage a vSan infrastructure.

## run

Docker run is a composite operation for pull, create, start.  As such, the parameter support is equivalent to that of docker create.
