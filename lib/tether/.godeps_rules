# By default, packages in lib should depend only on packages under pkg or vendor
^pkg/*
^vendor/*

# Tether subpackages can depend on each other
^lib/tether/*

# Tether can also depend on the following libraries
^lib/archive/*
^lib/config/executor/*
^lib/dhcp/*
^lib/etcconf/*
^lib/system/*

# BAD: Test code depends on lib/migration/feature for the same reason as pkg/version
^lib/migration/feature/*
