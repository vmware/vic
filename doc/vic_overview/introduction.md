# Introduction to vSphere Integrated Containers

vSphere Integrated Containers provides developers the portability, speed, and agility of using  enterprise-class containers, and provide IT Ops the management, security, and visibility they require to run workloads in production.

vSphere Integrated Containers enables IT teams to run traditional and container workloads side-by-side on existing infrastructure seamlessly.

Using constructs from the Open Container Initiative to map Docker containers to vSphere infrastructure, vSphere Integrated Containers are provisioned as virtual machines, offering the same security and functionality of virtual machines in ESXi.

A virtual container host is compatible with standard Docker client tools and backed by a pool of resources to accommodate applications.

From a developer's perspective, vSphere Integrated Containers is a seamless Docker interface for containers with a vSphere back end. Developers can deploy, test, and run container processes faster in the same environment as traditional applications.

## Interoperability with Other VMware Software

IT administrators can use vCenter Server to view and manage containers.

The vRealize Suite is available for health monitoring, performance analysis, and compliance across private and public clouds to move businesses faster.

IT teams can assure service-level agreements for container workloads with VMware vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler as well as reduce planned and unplanned downtime with VMware vSphere High Availability and VMware vSphere vMotion.

IT administrators can apply fine-grained network micro-segmentation and policy-based security to cloud-native applications with VMware NSX and also obtain greater visibility into the behavior of containers. VMware NSX integrates containers with the rest of the datacenter, and can be connected to various quarantine, forensics, and monitoring networks for additional monitoring and troubleshooting.

vSphere Integrated Containers allows you to create and run multiple containers rapidly with minimal overhead using vSphere 6 Instant Clone technology, which provisions child VMs forked directly from a parent VM template running a Linux kernel. vSphere Integrated Containers creates the kernel and a few supporting resources to run containers using Photon OS technology.
