# VIC Release Process

## Release cycle

VIC is developed using a feature driven model. Requirements are broken down into
features and then sized to ensure they will fit into our monthly releases.  Any
features that do not are then reworked until they will fit. Any features under
active development that do not make the monthly release will be pushed into the
next months version.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs-and-creating-issues) for details on how issues are prioritized and tracked.

## Release details

VIC is released in both source and binary form. The source is tagged using github
tagging methods. This is manual for now.

The binary releases are posted at https://bintray.com/vmware/vic/Download/view

### Update README.md and documentation

The main repo README contains a project status relating to the latest tagged release
along with guidance on how to build, deploy, et al. The latter should be updated by
any commits changing those workflows, but the status and what's new needs to be addressed
as part of the release process.

* create a PR, "Release x.y", with the corresponding doc updates once tagging is imminent
* merge that PR as the last thing that occurs prior to tagging
* tag the release as described in the next section

### Tag The Release

* Follow the above Release Versioning for choosing the new version.
* Gather the Release Notes file.
* Go to https://github.com/vmware/vic/releases and click on Draft a new release.
* Add the tag version that meets the requirements for this release.
* Title the release "vSphere Integrated Containers Version X.Y.Z" where X.Y.Z meets
    the versioning requirements. 
* Paste the release note file contents into the Write field and preview.
* If this is release is non-production ready select the "This is a pre-release" box.


### Create the VIC binary package

    (search for `shasum`)
* Download the artifact from
    [https://bintray.com/vmware/vic-repo/build](https://bintray.com/vmware/vic-repo/build)
* Verify the SHA256 sum of the downloaded version

  ```
    shasum -a 256 vic_<BUILD_NUMBER>.tar.gz
  ```
