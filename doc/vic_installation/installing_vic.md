# Installing vSphere Integrated Containers

The installation process for vSphere Integrated Containers involves several steps. vSphere Integrated Containers requires you to configure your environment correctly before you begin the installation.

In this technical preview, there are two installation options.

* A command line installer, that deploys virtual container hosts to VMware ESXi&trade; hosts or VMware vCenter Server&reg; instances, for you to use with Docker. This is the default installation method.
* An OVA installer that graphically deploys a vSphere Integrated Containers management server. The management server allows you to install the vSphere Integrated Containers extension to the VMware vSphere Web Client. The management server also allows you to deploy virtual container hosts directly from the vSphere Web Client. 

**NOTE** In this technical preview, the OVA installer and the vSphere Web Client extension are experimental.
