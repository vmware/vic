# Port Layer - Networking

A Virtual Container Host (VCH) presents a cluster of resource as a single endpoint, so while we must also supply transparent cross host networking, it must be there without requiring any user configuration.
In conjunction with [the provisioning workflows](docker-machine.md) it should also allow mapping of specific vSphere/NSX networks into the docker network namespace, and mapping of existing network entities (e.g. database servers) into the docker container namespace with defined aliases.

Initial design and implementation details for MVP are [here](networking/MVPnetworking.md).
