# Obtain a Virtual Container Host #

vSphere Integrated Containers Engine does not provide an automated means of obtaining virtual container hosts to container developers who are not vSphere administrators.

To obtain virtual container hosts, follow your company's internally defined procedures, or ask your vSphere administrator.
