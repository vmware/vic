# Virtual Container Host Status Reference #

The Web-based administration portal for virtual container hosts, VCH Admin, presents status information about a virtual container host.

If the vSphere environment in which you are deploying a virtual container host does not meet the requirements, the deployment does not succeed. However, a successfully deployed virtual container host can stop functioning if the vSphere environment changes after the deployment. If environment changes adversely affect the virtual container host, the status of the affected component changes from green to yellow or red.

## Virtual Container Host (VCH) ##

VCH Admin checks the status of the processes that the virtual container host runs:

- The port layer server, that presents an API of low-level container primitive operations, and implements those container operations via the vSphere APIs.
- VIC Admin server, that runs the VCH Admin portal. 
- The vSphere Integrated Containers Engine initialization service and watchdog service for the other components. 
- The Docker engine server, that exposes the Docker API and semantics, translating those composite operations into port layer primitives.

### Error ###

The Virtual Container Host status is yellow.

#### Cause ####

One or more of the virtual container host processes is not running correctly.

#### Solution ####

1. In the VCH Admin portal for the virtual container host, click the link for the **VIC Admin Server** log.
2. Search the log for references to the different virtual container host processes.

  The different processes are identified in the log by the following names:

  - `port-layer-server`
  - `vicadmin`
  - `vic-init`
  - `docker-engine-server`

3. Identify the process or processes that are not running correctly and attempt to remediate the issues as required.

## Network Connectivity ##

VCH Admin checks external network connectivity by attempting to connect from the virtual container host to docker.io and google.com. VCH Admin only checks the external network connection. It does not check other networks, for example the bridge, management, client, or container networks.

### Error ###

The Network Connectivity status is red.

#### Cause ####

The external network connection is down.

#### Solution ####

1. In the VCH Admin portal for the virtual container host, click the link for the **VIC Admin Server** log.
2. Search the log for references to network issues.
3. In the vSphere Web Client, remediate the network issues as required.

## Firewall ##

VCH Admin checks that the firewall is correctly configured on the ESXi host or the ESXi hosts in the cluster on which the virtual container host is running.

### Error ###

The Firewall status is yellow and shows the error `Firewall must permit 2377/tcp outbound to use VIC`.

#### Cause ####

The firewall on the ESXi host on which the virtual container host is running no longer allows outbound connections on port 2377.

- The firewall was switched off when the virtual container host was deployed. The firewall has been switched on since the deployment of the virtual container host.
- A firewall ruleset was applied to the ESXi host to allow outbound connections on port 2377. The ESXi host has been rebooted since the deployment of the virtual container host. Firewall rulesets are not retained when an ESXi host reboots.

#### Solution ####

Reconfigure the firewall on the ESXi host or hosts to allow  outbound connections on port 2377. For information about how to reconfigure the firewall on ESXi hosts, see [VCH Deployment Fails with Firewall Validation Error](../vic_installation/ts_firewall_error.html) in *vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Installation*.


### Error ###
The Firewall status is yellow.

#### Cause ####
The management network is down, or the virtual container host endpoint VM is unable to connect to vSphere.

#### Solution ####

Restore the connection to the management network.

## License ##

VCH Admin checks that the ESXi hosts on which you deploy virtual container hosts have the appropriate licenses.

### Error ###

The License status is yellow and shows the error `License does not meet minimum requirements to use VIC`.

#### Cause ####

The license for the ESXi host or for one or more of the hosts in a vCenter Server cluster on which the virtual container host is deployed has been removed, downgraded, or has expired since the deployment of the virtual container host.

#### Solution ####

- If the virtual container host is running on an ESXi host that is not managed by vCenter Server, replace the ESXi host license with a valid vSphere Enterprise license.
- If the virtual container host is running on a standalone ESXi host in vCenter Server, replace the ESXi host license with a valid vSphere Enterprise Plus license.
- If the virtual container host is running in a vCenter Server cluster, check that all of the hosts in the cluster have a valid vSphere Enterprise Plus license, and replace any licenses that have been removed, downgraded, or have expired.

### Error ###
The License status is yellow.

#### Cause ####
The management network is down, or the virtual container host endpoint VM is unable to connect to vSphere.

#### Solution ####

Restore the connection to the management network.
