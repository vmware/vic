# Interoperability of vSphere Integrated Containers Engine with Other VMware Software
IT administrators use vCenter Server to view and manage containers. vSphere Integrated Containers Engine works seamlessly with VMware products. 

## VMware vRealize&reg; Suite 
vRealize Suite is available for health monitoring, performance analysis, and compliance across private and public clouds to move businesses faster.

## VMware vSphere vMotion&reg;  

IT teams can assure service-level agreements for container workloads with VMware vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler&trade; (DRS) as well as reduce planned and unplanned downtime with VMware vSphere vMotion.

You can restart or upgrade the virtual container host without needing to take the containers offline during the process. You do not require a native agent on the ESXi host. The appliance VM does not need to be running for vMotion to occur. Clusters with non-container VMs can also vMotion with fully automated DRS.

## VMware vSAN
The virtual container host maintains filesystem layers inherent in container images by mapping to discrete VMDK files, all of which can be housed in vSphere datastores on vSAN, NFS, or local disks.
