# vSphere Integrated Containers Interoperability with Other VMware Software
IT administrators use vCenter Server to view and manage containers. vSphere Integrated Containers work seamlessly with VMware products. 

#### vRealize Suite 
The vRealize Suite is available for health monitoring, performance analysis, and compliance across private and public clouds to move businesses faster.

#### vSphere High Availability, Fault Tolerance, and vSphere vMotion 
IT teams can assure service-level agreements for container workloads with VMware vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler as well as reduce planned and unplanned downtime with VMware vSphere High Availability and VMware vSphere vMotion.

You can apply vSphere High Availability and Fault Tolerance to both the container VMs and the virtual container host, so that containers and the virtual container host can power on or off independently of each other. 

You can also restart or upgrade the virtual container host without needing to take the containers offline during the process.

#### VMware Virtual SAN
The virtual container host maintains filesystem layers inherent in container images by mapping to discrete VMDK files, all of which are housed in vSphere datastores on VSAN, NFS, or local disks.

#### vSphere Instant Clone
vSphere Integrated Containers allows you to create and run multiple containers rapidly with minimal overhead using vSphere 6 Instant Clone technology, which provisions child VMs forked directly from a parent VM template running a Linux kernel. vSphere Integrated Containers creates the kernel and a few supporting resources to run containers using Photon OS technology.
