# Access vSphere Integrated Containers Engine Log Bundles #

vSphere Integrated Containers Engine provides log bundles that you can download from the VCH Admin portal.

- The **VCH Bundle** contains logs that relate specifically to the virtual container host that you created.
- The **VCH and Container Bundle** also includes the logs regarding  the containers that a virtual container host manages. 
- Live logs (tail files) allow you to view the absolute current status of how components, such as the portlayer and Docker, are running. 

Live logs can help you see how any current changes you make might affect the logs. For example, when you try to trouble shoot an issue, you can see if your attempt worked or failed by looking at the live logs.

The non-live version of the logs are good for sharing with administrators or others to help solve issues.
