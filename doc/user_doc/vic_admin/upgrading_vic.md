# Upgrading vSphere Integrated Containers Engine #

To upgrade vSphere Integrated Containers Engine, you upgrade existing virtual container hosts (VCHs) individually, and upgrade the client plug-in.

**NOTE**: No new development work is planned for the plug-in for the Flex-based vSphere Web Client. New features will only be added to the plug-in for the HTML5 vSphere Client. There is no upgrade for the Flex-based client.
