# Install the Flex Plug-In on vCenter Server for Windows Without Access to a Web Server #

You can install the Flex-based vSphere Web Client plug-in for vSphere Integrated Containers on a vCenter Server 6.0 or 6.5 instance for Windows that does not have access to a Web Server.

**Prerequisites**

- You deployed at least one virtual container host (VCH) to a vCenter Server instance that runs on Windows.
- You must use a Windows system to run the script to install the plug-in on a vCenter Server that runs on Windows. If you usually use a Linux or Mac OS system to run `vic-machine`, download and unpack the vSphere Integrated Containers Engine package on a Windows system. For example, download the package to the Windows system on which vCenter Server is running.

**Procedure**

1. On the Windows system on which you have downloaded and unpacked vSphere Integrated Containers Engine, open the `\vic\ui\vsphere-client-serenity\` folder.
2. Copy the entire <code>com.vmware.vic.ui-<i>version</i></code> folder into the folder on the vCenter Server system that contains the vSphere Web Client packages.
  
    Destination location on vCenter Server Windows system: <pre><i>instl_dir</i>\vCenterServer\cfg\vsphere-client\vc-packages\vsphere-client-serenity\com.vmware.vic.ui-<i>version</i></pre>

    <code><i>instl_dir</i></code> is the location in which vCenter Server is installed. If the `vc-packages\vsphere-client-serenity` folders do not exist under the <code>vsphere-client</code> folder, create them manually.
3. Open the `\vic\ui\vCenterForWindows\configs` file in a text editor.
4. Enter the IPv4 address or FQDN of the vCenter Server instance on which to install the plug-in.<pre>SET target_vcenter_ip=<i>vcenter_server_address</i></pre>
6. Save and close the `configs` file.
7. Open a command prompt, navigate to `\vic\ui\vCenterForWindows`, and run the installer.<pre>install.bat</pre>
9. Enter the user name and password for the vCenter Server administrator account.
10. When installation finishes, if you are logged into the vSphere Web Client, log out then log back in again.

**What to Do Next**

Check that the deployment has succeeded by following the procedure in [Verify the Deployment of the Flex Plug-In](plugin_verify_deployment.md).
