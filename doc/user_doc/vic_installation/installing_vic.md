# Installing vSphere Integrated Containers

You install vSphere Integrated Containers by using a command line installer, that deploys virtual container hosts to VMware ESXi&trade; hosts or VMware vCenter Server&reg; instances. You can connect a Docker client to the virtual container hosts and use the Docker client to work with containers and container images that are managed in a vSphere environment.
