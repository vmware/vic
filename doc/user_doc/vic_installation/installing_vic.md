# Installing vSphere Integrated Containers

You install vSphere Integrated Containers by using a command line installer, that deploys virtual container hosts to VMware ESXi&trade; hosts or VMware vCenter Server&reg; instances. You can connect Docker clients to the virtual container hosts and use the Docker client to work with containers. You can use your vSphere environment to manage the container VMs and container images.
