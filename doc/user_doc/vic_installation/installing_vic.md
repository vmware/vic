# Installing vSphere Integrated Containers Engine

You install vSphere Integrated Containers Engine by using a command line installer, `vic-machine`, that deploys virtual container hosts to VMware ESXi&trade; hosts or VMware vCenter Server&reg; instances. You connect Docker clients to the virtual container hosts and use the Docker clients to work with containers. You use your vSphere environment to manage the container VMs and container images.
