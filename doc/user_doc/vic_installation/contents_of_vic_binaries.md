# Contents of the vSphere Integrated Containers Binaries 

After you download and unpack the vSphere Integrated Containers binary bundle, you obtain following files:

| **File** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
|```appliance.iso``` | The ISO from which a virtual container host appliance boots.|
|```bootstrap.iso``` | A Photon OS kernel from which container VMs boot.|
|```vic_machine``` | The command line installation and management utility for virtual container hosts. The current builds of the ```vic_machine``` utility only run on Linux OS.|

If you build the vSphere Integrated Containers binaries manually, you find the ISO files and the ```vic_machine``` utility in the `<git_installation_dir>/vic/bin` folder.
